- control music on your device
- more? If you can do it via keyboard, mouse or touch, you can do it with SwiftControl

  - make sure you have installed the "[Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime libraries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)"
  - Windows may flag the app as virus. I think it does so because the app does control the mouse and keyboard.
- [Web](https://jonasbark.github.io/swiftcontrol/) (you won't be able to do much)

## Troubleshooting
- Your Zwift device is found but connection does not work properly? You may need to update the firmware in Zwift Companion app.
- The Android app is losing connection over time? Read about how to [keep the app alive](https://dontkillmyapp.com/).

## How does it work?
The app connects to your Zwift device automatically. 

- When using Android a "click" on a certain part of the screen is simulated to trigger the action.
- When using macOS or Windows a keyboard or mouse click is used to trigger the action. 
  - there are predefined Keymaps for MyWhoosh and indieVelo / Training Peaks
  - you can also create your own Keymaps for any other app
  - you can also use the mouse to click on a certain part of the screen, or use keyboard shortcuts
